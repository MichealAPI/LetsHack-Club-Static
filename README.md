Welcome to LetsHack.club, the static interface for our hackathon hosted at our high school. This README.md file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to get started.

## About the Hackathon
The LetsHack.club hackathon is an exciting event organized by our hackclubbers at Panetti Pitagora. It aims to bring together students who are passionate about coding, problem-solving, and innovation. Participants will have the opportunity to collaborate, learn, and showcase their skills in a friendly and competitive environment.
